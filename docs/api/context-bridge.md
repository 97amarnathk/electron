# contextBridge

> Create a safe, bi-directional, synchronous bridge across isolated contexts

Process: [Renderer](../glossary.md#renderer-process)

An example of exposing an API to a renderer from an isolated preload script is given below:

```javascript
// Preload (Isolated World)
const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require('electron')

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld(
  'electron',
  {
    doThing: () => ipcRenderer.send('do-a-thing')
  }
)
```

```javascript
// Renderer (Main World)

window.electron.doThing()
```

## Glossary

### Main World

The "Main World" is the javascript context that your main renderer code runs in.  By default the page you load in your renderer
executes code in this world.

### Isolated World

When `contextIsolation` is enabled in your `webPreferences` your `preload` scripts run in an "Isolated World".  You can read more about
context isolation and what it affects in the [BrowserWindow](browser-window.md) docs.

## Methods

The `contextBridge` module has the following instance methods:

### `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld(apiKey, api)`

* `apiKey` String - The key to inject the API onto `window` with.  The API will be accessible on `window[apiKey]`.
* `api` Record<String, any> - Your API object, more information on what this API can be and how it works is available below.

## Usage

### API Objects

The `api` object provided to [`exposeInMainWorld`](#contextbridgeexposeInMainWorldapikey-api-options) must be an object
whose keys are strings and values are a `Function`, `String`, `Number`, `Array`, `Boolean` or another nested object that meets the same conditions.

`Function` values are proxied to the other context and all other values are **copied** and **frozen**.  I.e. Any data / primtives sent in
the API object become immutable and updates on either side of the bridge do not result in an update on the other side.

An example of a complex API object is shown below.

```javascript
const { contextBridge } = require('electron')

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld(
  'electron',
  {
    doThing: () => ipcRenderer.send('do-a-thing'),
    myPromises: [Promise.resolve(), Promise.reject()],
    anAsyncFunction: async () => return 123,
    data: {
      myFlags: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
      bootTime: 1234
    },
    nestedAPI: {
      evenDeeper: {
        youCanDoThisAsMuchAsYouWant: {
          fn: () => ({
            returnData: 123
          })
        }
      }
    }
  }
)
```

### API Functions

`Function` values that you bind through the `contextBridge` are proxied through Electron to ensure that contexts remain isolated.  This
results in some key limitations that we've outlined below.

#### Parameter / Error / Return Type support

Because parameters, errors and return values are **copied** when they are sent over the bridge there are only certain types that can be used.
At a high level if the type you want to use can be serialized and un-serialized into the same object it will work.  A table of type support
has been included below for completeness.

| Type | Complexity | Parameter Support | Return Value Support | Limitations |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| `String` | Simple | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| `Number` | Simple | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| `Boolean` | Simple | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| `Object` | Complex | ✅ | ✅ | Keys must be supported "Simple" types in this table.  Values must be supported in this table.  Prototype modifications are dropped.  Sending custom classes will copy values but not the prototype. |
| `Array` | Complex | ✅ | ✅ | Same limitations as the `Object` type |
| `Error` | Complex | ✅ | ✅ | Errors that are thrown are also copied, this can result in the message and stack trace of the error changing slightly due to being thrown in a different context |
| `Promise` | Complex | ✅ | ✅ | Promises are only proxied if they are a the return value or exact parameter.  Promises nested in arrays or obejcts will be dropped. |
| `Function` | Complex | ✅ | ✅ | Prototype modifications are dropped.  Sending classes or constructors will not work. |
| `Symbol` | N/A | ❌ | ❌ | Symbols cannot be copied across contexts so they are dropped |


If the type you care about is not in the above table it is probably not supported.

### Performance

Electron will attempt to proxy any object, array or other structure you provide the `contextBridge` module.  This includes method parameters, method return types, etc.  This can be quite costly when sending large data blobs.  If you need more performance out of the bridge and you are sending data, no methods or dynamic content then we recommend you `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` the content across the bridge.  E.g.

```javascript
// Isolated World
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld(
  'electron',
  {
    getData: () => JSON.stringify(myLargeData)
)

// Main World
console.log(JSON.parse(window.electron.getData()))
```

Your mileage may vary and before you start stringifying everything we recommend that you measure the speed of both to see which one works best for you.
